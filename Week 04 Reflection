This week I learned about version control using Git and GitHub.  
I created my first repository and understood how commits and branches work.

**Challenges:**  
- Understanding merge conflicts.  

**Solutions:**  
- Practiced with small files and read documentation.

**Learning outcome:**  
I now feel confident using Git for collaborative work.
